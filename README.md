The jupuyter labs file is quite a mess right now, but it does follow somewhat of a structure. 

First few blocks are the simulations classes, followed by the neccesary functions needed to calculate clustering. The last few blocks are to run the actual simulation.

What follows after is a single simulation run with all its plots. Followed by benchmark runs to test clustering. 

After that a bunch of runs are done for sensitivity analysis followed by the needed plots to check for a stable outcome. 

The file ends with a run of this model applied to Heron Island followed by the same plots as in the single run done at the start.
